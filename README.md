#Project description
A completely unnecessary, sarcasm-loaded web app that reads your emotion (or vibes) and gives you *absolutely unscientific* predictions about your future — whether you're happy, angry, sad, or just confused.
#The problem:
The world lacks a platform that takes your feelings and turns them into funny, chaotic, or brutally honest “future predictions” — like "You will not get married, but you’ll own three cats." 
We saw this non-existent gap and proudly dove head-first.
#The Solution  
You select your mood — empathy, anger, happiness, boredom, overthinking mode, etc.  
Then we generate:
- ✨ Fake predictions (mildly cursed)  
- 💬 Relatable quotes  
- 🌦️ Emotional weather reports  
- 😬 Emoji-enhanced results that don't really help  

Sometimes it motivates you. Sometimes it makes you spiral. That’s balance.
